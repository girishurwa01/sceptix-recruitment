    <li> The origins of FOSS go back to the 1950s. When the hardware was purchased, there used to be no additional charges for bundled software and the source code would also be available in order to fix possible bugs in the software.
    </li>
    <br>
    It was actually a common practice back then for users with the freedom to customize the code.
    <br>
    <li>
    At that time, primarily academicians and researchers in the industry were the collaborators to develop such software.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        The term Open Source was not there yet. Instead, the term that was popular at that time was “Public Domain Software”. As of today, ideologically, both are very much different in nature even though they may sound similar.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li> Back in 1955, some users of the IBM 701 computer system from Los Angeles, voluntarily founded a group called SHARE. The “SHARE Program Library Agency” (SPLA) distributed information and software through magnetic tapes.
    </li> 
    <br>
    <li> Technical information shared, was about progsramming languages, operating systems, database systems, and user experiences for enterprise users of small, medium, and large-scale IBM computers.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li> The initiative that is now more than 60 years old, continues to follow its goals quite actively. SHARE has its upcoming event coming up as SHARE Phoenix 2019. You can download and check out their complete timeline here.
